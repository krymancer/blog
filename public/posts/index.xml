      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t remember exactly when I started to using linux, probably I had my frist real contact in 2014 trying ubuntu, debian and kali. It was years latter, in college, that I tried to run daily. I was so comfortable in windows so I didn&amp;rsquo;t really saw an reason to change. Debian was my first daily option, I was in a class about embedded systems programming and we need to use a gcc cross compiler, some programs to create linux images, copy code to development boards memory and stuff. The professor really wanted us to use linux, my colleges dual booted their machines but I took this as an opportunity to really try to daily drive linux.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in my journey of trying to learn zig on one of those days when I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get myself to sleep I thought, why not make a game using zig? Yes, the question is always &amp;ldquo;why?&amp;rdquo; and the answer is always &amp;ldquo;why not?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So another one of my phases began, I started looking into some lib or anything that I cloud make an 2d game, I was thinking in using &lt;a href=&#34;https://libsdl.org/&#34;&gt;SDL&lt;/a&gt; as I already use it in the past with C++, but I remembered &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.raylib.com/index.html&#34;&gt;raylib&lt;/a&gt; and found out about &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Not-Nik/raylib-zig&#34;&gt;raylib-zig&lt;/a&gt; and was an sign for me to start.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Building a JSON Parser in Rust</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I recently took on a challenge to build my own JSON parser in Rust. This project was a fantastic opportunity to dive deep into parsing techniques, which are crucial for everything from simple data formats to building compilers. You can find the full details of the challenge &lt;a href=&#34;https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-json-parser&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and the source code in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Krymancer/cc-json-parser&#34;&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-challenge&#34;&gt;The Challenge&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The challenge was structured to incrementally build a JSON parser, starting with simple JSON objects and progressively handling more complex structures. Here&amp;rsquo;s a step-by-step breakdown of the process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I found myself not really excited to code anything and that was really bothering me. I was always excited to code something, learning something new and not being able to enjoy it or have the motivation to do it was really driving me crazy. I don&amp;rsquo;t really know what was the cause but I can&amp;rsquo;t do anytthing, I felt like I was justing being lazy, tried to read a book, or take a time for myself but nothing really helped. So I started to serching for a new project that I cloud make and be excited about, nothing really caught my eye, same basic projects as aways, frontend projects are either too simple or have some gimmic that I didn&amp;rsquo;t really care at the moment, backend projects are always CRUD at this point. I was really lost, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what to do, I was really sad about it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My First Zig API</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s this event, which is conceived by Zanfranceschi. Essentially, Zan gave us a specification that we followed to implement an API. For this first quarter edition of 2024, we have a kind of &amp;ldquo;Bank&amp;rdquo; where some pre-registered clients check their statements and make transactions. If you want to read more details, I invite you to take a look at the repository of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/zanfranceschi/rinha-de-backend-2024-q1&#34;&gt;event&lt;/a&gt;, where you can find the specifications along with the rest of the participation instructions and related information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
