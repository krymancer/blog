At this point, if you don't live under a rock, you should've heard of Omarchy. I don't wanna say that is a distro since it isn't, but is an arch that comes with an script that configures and install everything, so you can have an development ready environment. 

A few things before we continue, you might or might now know, but I've been using linux for a decade at this point, and arch for at least 4 years in a daily basis. I've become attached to Arch linux and is my distro of choice whenever I can (WSL, Docker containers if makes sense, and so on). I already used hyprland and had spend countless hours customizing and tailoring my experience and making the system feel like my own. 
This is fun and I learn so much, feel in love with so much great open source projects and programs, some of them really changed the way I think and make things. But at some point you just become tired. Unfortunately this happened to me. 

And a few months after that I discover omarchy, and I couldn't believe. SImply, impressive, an fully configured, arch linux installation, with working audio, bluetooth, wifi, multi monitor setup. I've put so may hours in installing and configuring arch linux in different devices that I has impressed by this alone.  The other part that makes me want to continue using omarchy is the community, It's an active community that not only march toward making the scripts and solving problems, but also helps different people achieve things, It's not like Arch, hyprland, and many other tools omarchy uses hadn't a great community, but it's the centralization of people roughly using the same set of tools and scripts that made possible such an impressive set of tools, for customizing, working and just achieve anything with an machine. 

After trying, and failing, to use nixos (more on this latter) I finally found something that I can just load an a computer and start using in more or less 5 minutes with almost no configuration. I like omarchy very much, you should try it.
