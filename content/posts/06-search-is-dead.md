At this point I expect you to realize that search is dead, no it wasn't because of LLM's, those just made it clearer sooner, and as much as I have the incorporation of AI on every single thing on earth it was not AI faults, at least not in the beginning. 

I started using computers from a very young age, at least in my community, like 7 or 8 years old. My internet was BAD, I mean it, BAD, in the later 2000's internet was not too bad, at least not in where I live, but we couldn't afford it, so I used some 2 digit Kbps internet for a lot of time. This with being an impatient child made me optimize a lot of things that I did in the computer, for download games, videos, and most importantly searching.

When you have to wait like 10 or so seconds for an google page fully load, you better make it count, so I wasn't trying to waste and page load on a bad search, I was cutting sentences, combining keywords, using English (Its not my first language) so I got the most results. and at some point in my 12~14 I was efficient, still same bad internet but now, starting learning how to code I cloud find answers much faster, and this helped learn, a lot, stack overflow was great, is was like the combo google + reddit, before everything in reddit being BS and we cloud use it properly anymore. 

I don't know exactly the point that I'm trying to make here but I don't like this, the internet now days is bad, we are losing data, anywhere from migrating blogs, forums and communities to discord, where we can't reliable search nor find anything (Iif you use discord had you tried to search something you send 6 months ago? maybe last year? good fucking luck with that)

I just fell bad for this yk? And I had to talk about it somewhere, even if nobody will ever hear (read).
