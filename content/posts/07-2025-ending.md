Today is December 14 of 2025, this year I did a lot of things. I started going to the Gym, I changed jobs, I bought a old honda, broke and fixed it (yay!) and I noticed one thing that I never had before. 

I fucking suck!

I am afraid of commitment (kinda of), I really don't like change and I really don't put myself out there, this make so I'm not really improving, being in be more fit, losing weight, or not studying enough. 

I guess realizing this is one step forward, but what good is going to make if I don't do anything about it? Doing things is hard and I am bad at it, this only makes harder, this can be everything from trying to brake my bench press PR, from doing 30 minutes of cardio on the treadmill on my gym. But I only want to say that, despite everything, keep going, I don't know if is supposed to be hard, but it is, and maybe in the end wasn't too bad, just appear to be, you don't have to always be good, just good enough. 

Be safe, keep going, despite everything.
